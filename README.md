# Covid-Detection-on-Chest-X-Ray-images-using-Pytorch

The dataset can be taken from Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database

The implementation is done in pytorch using pretrained Resnet18 CNN model 

The image classfication is done on 3 classes:
  1. Normal
  2. Viral  Pneumonia
  3. Covid-19
  
  ## **TO-DO**
  
  - [ ] Use my own Chest XRays taken during COVID hospitalization and post discharge as test data to the model
